  					<h2>Who is OWL?</h2>
 					 <p>Owls are well known as being very versatile birds when it comes to their habitat. They are able to live in a variety of locations and some of those may surprise you. The most common place to find owls living is in wooded areas. They have a place to call their own territory and where they can hide during the day from predators. They also have access to lots of different food sources because of the other living creatures in the forest.</p>

  					<h2>Where they live?</h2>
 					 <p>There are some species of owls that are able to live in the rainforests. They do very well with the humidity and the rainfall. They are able to find great places to live that protect them from their environment. However, the trade off is that they seem to have more predators that they need to hide from or to protect themselves from.</p>

  					<h2>A Surprise Fact!</h2>
 					 <p>It may surprise you though to learn that some owls live in the grasslands and the open prairie. They are able to find lots of food sources in these areas. They donâ€™t seem to mind the heat either because they are sleeping and in cool shaded areas during the day. The Elf Owl is one that is able to live in the desert and they are found out there with the cactus..</p>
