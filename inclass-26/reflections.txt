1. I really learnt a lot in this course, from the frontend to the backend.
2. The course schedule is really tight, so I think I kind of improved my study ability.
3. But I haven't gone through a lot of materials covered in this course.
4. Actually, I prefer backend to frontend. I really want to learn more about backend, so i think maybe the frontend and backend part can be balanced according to student's preference? But that's hard.
5. Lastly, I really want to say thanks to our professor. You really help us a lot! Hope you teach other courses!
